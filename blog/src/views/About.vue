          <h2 class="subtitle">Stumbling into volleyball</h2>
          <div class="content">
            <p>I didn't make the baseball team freshman year of high school. Luckily, the head volleyball coach had a policy requiring upperclassmen to bring an 1st or 2nd year to tryouts. I made the team because I was tall. I loved it. Stumbling into volleyball is the highlight of my teenage years. I hope to help more people learn and love this sport.</p>
            <p>Volleyball did not come naturally and in a way I'm grateful for the struggle. It sparked an interest in learning, shaped my understanding of the game, and led me to coach. I write here mostly to help myself think. Feel free to discuss anyhere here with me on Twitter.
