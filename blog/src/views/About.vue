              I didn't make the baseball team freshman year of high school. That was bad because my family moved almost yearly and sports teams = friends. Luckily for me the head volleyball coach had a policy requiring upperclassmen to bring an 1st or 2nd year to tryouts. I only made the team because I was tall, but I loved it. Stumbling into volleyball is the highlight of my teenage years. I hope to help more people love this sport.</p>

              Volleyball did not come naturally and I'm grateful for those struggles. They sparked my interest in teaching, helped form my understanding of the game, and led me to coach. I write here mostly to help myself think and I'd encourage you to ask me any questions on Twitter.
