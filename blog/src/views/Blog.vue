          <!-- <h2 class="subtitle">Team Cognition</h2> -->
          <div class="content">
            <p>"Talk! Call the ball!" is a poor response to balls dropped between players.</p>

            <p>Overdependence on communication benefits only the player with the loudest voice or worst hearing. Play unfolds too quickly for coordination reliant on talk. You need team cognition.</p>

            <p>Team cognition arises when a group has a shared mental model of what they're doing, how they'll do it, and who’ll do what.</p>

            <p>When every kid on a soccer field runs to the ball —abandoning goalposts, defense, and dandelions— they have a shared mental model: <i>Get the ball.</i></p>

            <p>When two best friends on a basketball team only pass to each other they have a shared mental model: <i>My friend is good and passes to me.</i></p>

            <p>When your front-row setter sprints to dive for a ball in deep zone five while the rest of the team watches they have a shared mental model: <i>The setter always gets the second ball.</i></p>

            <p>Your job as a coach is not only to align mental models but to shape them. You develop a strategy and evangelize it.</p>

            <p>So when a ball drops, ask questions. What type of mistake was made? Did your players incorrectly respond to a correctly identified situation or not recognize the situation at all?</p>

            <p>Mistakes reveal cracks in cognition. Approach them like a teacher, not a principle. Ask questions, understand what happened —then guide your team towards a better response.</p>

            <p>You should encourage talk. Communication illuminates grey areas. A back-row player overriding the setter on a poor pass must gesture and yell. A libero taking a first ball from another player must make her presence known. Talk helps with assurances and audibles, but coordination arises from a tempered system.</p>

          <div class="content">
            <p>Frustration sparks when our performance doesn't match our expectations. Unfortunately, our expectations often differ from the realities of learning.</p>
            <p>The simplest, wrongest view of progress is the expectation of linearity. The belief that more time in -> better performance: 5 units of time always creating to 5 units of ability.</p>
            <img style="width: 70%; min-width: 350px" src="../assets/linear.png">
            <p>This model of progress is clearly wrong to anyone who's ever been tired, stressed, or sore. Some practice is better than others. Some days you perform better than others. Expectations of noticeable, consistent improvement tempt frustration.</p>
            <p>A better model of progress must account for day-to-day variability.</p>
            <p>The improved model is ugly, but real. Select sessions precipitate great advances, others no change —and some sting with regressions.</p>
            <img style="width: 70%; min-width: 350px" src="../assets/fluctuating.png">
            <p>In this model day-by-day performance means little. Progress is the game of improving our average.</p>
            <img style="width: 70%; min-width: 350px" src="../assets/average.png">
            <p>Expect difficulties along the climb to greatness. Overcoming local maximas of skill will require many mistakes. If you expect perfection this time will suck.</p>

          <h1 class="title">Fundamental Skills</h1>
          <h2 class="subtitle">Awareness and Technique</h2>

          <div class="content">
            <p>You can have a lot of fun listening to the crowd at a high-level match. Amazed younger players exclaim "I would die if that serve came at me" or "She jumps so high!” But I think the most meaningful phrase to hear is "How did they know that was going to happen!"</p>
            
            <p>Professional athletes are impressive. Executing advanced technique with strength, grace, and consistency is no easy feat. But the real differentiator between professional and beginner is mental, not physical. Domain experts experience enables them to focus their attention on more important factors, recognize patterns faster, and make better predictions about their teammates and opponents. This is awareness.</p>
            
            <p>I split nearly everything in a sport into awareness and technique.</p>
            
            <p>Technique is the ability to execute specific skills (motor patterns) in a consistent manner.</p>
            
            <p>We practice technique. Hitting cross. Hitting line. Using the block to reset or tool. Tipping. These are the tools available to us; the motor patterns we practice until habitual.</p>
            
            <p>Awareness is the ability to read the game, recognize possibilities, and choose a response.</p>
            
            <p>We develop awareness too. It’s the skill of knowing what to look at, interpreting a most likely outcome, and choosing a reaction. It largely happens while you’re not touching the ball.</p>
            
            <p>The flow of sport is read, response. Awareness, technique. See, react.</p>
            
            <p>To see this flow let’s look to some Olympians. Watch this clip:</p>
          
            <iframe style="width: 100%; height: 400px;" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bLCXHfyocVA?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br><br>

            <p>We’ll focus on the action by Eric Shoji (near-side libero #22) and Micah Christenson (near-side setter #11). Wow. Watch the play again and only look at Shoji.</p>

            <p>Now let's break down what Shoji does to set himself up to make this play.</p>

            <p>He's playing middle back defense, so his first task figuring out where to position himself. Imagine a line splitting the court, hotdog style. Which side should he be on? How does he choose?</p>

            <img style="width: 100%; min-width: 350px" src="../assets/shoji-middle-back.gif">

            <p>I bet he watched the sharp angle of the hitters approach, see's his teammate's double block, and notices the inside set. (Awareness)</p>

            <p>Then, right before the hitter contacts, he does a tennis step. This is a one-two step aimed to ready a player for movement. (Technique)</p>

            <p>The rest is habit. Who should get the first ball, setter or libero? Shoji and Christenson both know.</p>

            <img style="width: 100%; min-width: 350px" src="../assets/shoji-backup.gif">

            <p>But there's a mistake and Shoji overpasses. Now, Christenson breaks the rules.</p>

            <p>It will take time for Shoji to return to middle back and Brazil runs a quick offense. So Christenson takes middle back and (since he's deviated from the norm) communicates to Shoji.</p>

            <img style="width: 100%; min-width: 350px" src="../assets/micah-shift.gif">

            <p>So, what is awareness?</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Reading your opponents</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Example: Watching a hitter to position yourself on defense</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Acting with knowledge of your team's system</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Example: Libero takes first ball over setter</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Recognizing abnormal situations</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Example: Christenson shuffles over to give Shoji time to get up</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>

            <p>It's great to watch pro-athletes. Unfortunately viewers tend to focus on who has the ball. Young players and scouting coaches could benefit from ignoring the classic phrase "keep your eyes on the ball." In my opinion, most of what makes an athlete great is in the anticipation, preparation, and focus show demonstrated by players out of the spotlight.</p>
