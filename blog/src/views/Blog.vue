          <p>Great hitters are looking for kills regardless of the set, score, or opponent. Each set should be viewed as an opportunity/challenge to score. 
          <br><br>
          I’ll break down hitting into two skills, awareness and technique. 
          <br><br>
          Technique is the ability to execute specific skills in a consistent manner.
          <br><br>
          Awareness is the ability to read the game, recognize possibilities, and choose an appropriate technique to utilize. 
          <br><br>
          We practice technique. Hitting cross. Hitting line. Using the block to reset or tool. Tipping. These are the tools available to us. The motor patterns we practice until habitual. 
          <br><br>
          Awareness is learned. It is seeing the game and understanding how to react. 
          <br><br>
          We practice awareness by using peripheral vision to see where the block is and choose to hit line or cross around it. Awareness is noticing an opposing middle blocker playing back row defense and choosing to hit and tip at them. Awareness is recognizing a trap (tight and low) set against a big block and choosing to tip, wipe, or reset rather than swing.
          <br><br>
          Each opportunity to attack should involve awareness, even if it’s only a glance at the block to see where to swing. Each hit should be intentional. Your attacking choice informed by the technique you’ve practiced and awareness of the situation. Recognize (awareness) then respond (technique).
          <br><br>
          If you hit with intent, getting blocked or dug is feedback. Perhaps you made the wrong choice or failed to see/recognize something. Video and coaches are also a great source of feedback.
          <br><br>
          To be a great hitter you should expand your toolbox but you also must recognize the job and know the right tool. Be intentional about your hitting and form habits around successful recognition-response patterns.
